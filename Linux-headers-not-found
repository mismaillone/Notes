I tried so many methods because i have purchase a wifi adapter TP LINK ac600 for packet Injection but when i get the tp link adapter and put it on kali 
doesn't work after lot of research i came to know i have to intall driver realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms  now try download the realtek driver but 
it won't install because my linux headers show nothing i completely update my kali but it doesn't show linux headers 

i tried commands 

1. sudo uname -r  
    here i found kernal verison.
 2. sudo apt install linux-headeres-$(uname -r)
but shows error
  <i>  Unable to locate package linux-headers-6.0.0-kali5-amd64
  Couldn't find any package by glob 'linux-headers-6.0.0-kali5-amd64'</i>

i tried lot of things but only this comand works for me 

<b>root@kali-Kali:/home/ghibli/rtl8812au# apt-get install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms</b>
